<b>The rest is is history </b><br>
Gravitational waves seemed a bit of a stretch,<br>
until some mad scientists made a pledge:<br>
To see space-time bend<br>
one laser to mirrors we'll send,<br>
and so the Nobel Prize they fetched. .<br>

A decade since the gravitational wave,<br>
A discovery about which we rave,<br> 
Why not write a rhyme,<br>
To celebrate this time,<br>
Submit your limerick, be brave!<br>

There will be a mission called LISA<br>
soon launched by NASA and ESA<br>
Taking Einstein to space<br>
there detecting his waves<br>
which for a hundred years were just a teaser.<br>
