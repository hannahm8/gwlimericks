<b>Limerick-007:<br></b><br>
I once discovered a gravitational wave,<br>
It was a struggle to make the computer behave,<br>
I set up the run,<br>
The calculation was done,<br>
But oh no, I forgot to press save.<br>

<b>Limerick-006:<br>Redshifted</b><br>
Big black holes are formed from stars<br>
So metal poor that they are situated far<br>
But inspiralling binaries all<br>
May contain black holes big or small<br>
The biggest ones lead to lead to GWs with high SNR<br>

<b>Limerick-005:<br>Case catalog</b><br>
You may have heard of gravitational waves<br>
They stretch and squeeze the 4D space<br>
Carrying information<br>
Of mergers and star formation<br>
We space detectives study them case by case<br>

<p style="font-size:11px" style="color:#3A003A;"><br><i>
<b>Limerick-004:<br>Postmortem</b><br>
Black holes can be thought of as the dead bodies of stars<br>
The life history of which is hidden in its parameters<br>
The sheriff has ordered an investigation<br>
So we must run a parameter estimation<br>
Cuz murderers and mergers always leave their signatures...<br>

<b>Limerick-003:<br>The rest is is history </b><br>
Gravitational waves seemed a bit of a stretch,<br>
until some mad scientists made a pledge:<br>
To see space-time bend<br>
one laser to mirrors we'll send,<br>
and so the Nobel Prize they fetched. .<br>

<b>Limerick-002</b><br>
A decade since the gravitational wave,<br>
A discovery about which we rave,<br> 
Why not write a rhyme,<br>
To celebrate this time,<br>
Submit your limerick, be brave!<br>

<b>Limerick-001:</b><br>
There will be a mission called LISA<br>
soon launched by NASA and ESA<br>
Taking Einstein to space<br>
there detecting his waves<br>
which for a hundred years were just a teaser.<br>
