<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>Celebrate a decade of gravitational-wave observation by composing your own gravitational-wave limerick!</p>
<p>A <a href="https://wordsforlife.org.uk/activities/how-write-limerick/">limerick</a> is a five line poem. Typically the first, second and fifth line rhyme with each other. The third and fourth line are typically shorter and also rhyme with each other. </p>

<p style="font-size:11px" style="color:#3A003A;"><br><i>
A decade since the gravitational wave,<br>
A discovery about which we rave,<br> 
Why not write a rhyme,<br>
To celebrate this time,<br>
Submit your limerick, be brave!<br>
</p>
