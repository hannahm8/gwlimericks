<h1>How to submit your limerick</h1>

<p>Celebrate a decade of gravitational-wave observation by composing your own gravitational-wave limerick!</p>

<p style="font-size:11px" style="color:#3A003A;"><br>
A decade since the gravitational wave,<br>
A discovery about which we rave,<br> 
Why not write a rhyme,<br>
To celebrate this time,<br>
Submit your limerick, be brave!<br>
