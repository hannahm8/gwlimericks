O1, the first Advanced LIGO observing run: for long years, the letters gleamed like glyphs from the future -- this week, it starts.<br>
Charts and checklists Megaparsecs-long are ended.<br>
My work here at AEI Hannover is calm compared to the buzz palpable in the online logbooks and in the voices down the hall.<br>
If we can see continuous gravitational waves from Scorpius X-1, then their trace will steadily build, perhaps discernible by winter.<br>
Yet those at the observatories and in the depths of the instrument must make their machines work all at once.<br>
Hectic days and sleepless nights!<br>
Millions of meters away, all I perceive is the quiet.<br>

"Dear Group", begins our director's email: we LIGO members are having special meeting.<br>
Maybe, I wonder, someone put in a blind injection.<br>
Big Dog came almost exactly five years ago, while I was a visitor at Hanford Observatory.<br>
We had rushed to measure the detector, to calibrate it threefold ways, to know whether that signal from Canis Major might be real.<br>
All was to be torn apart, so we had to hurry to make way for the future -- today's future.<br>
Then we waited six months to learn whether Big Dog was from the stars or ourselves.<br>
It was, as most had guess, the latter.<br>
What a strange decision to have a blind injection now!<br>
Maybe I am too suspicious; maybe today is just a briefing.<br>
<br>
Thirty or more scientists crowd into a room.<br>
Some sit with laptops open.<br>
I stand by a pillar.<br>
Our director enters, locking the door.<br>
"Should we close the blinds", I ask, semi-seriously.<br>
"Actually, that's a good idea", he replies, "There are a lot of people here for the conference".<br>
Blinds fell.<br>
The projector beamed a LIGO wiki page onto the wall.<br>
"This is not a blind injection".<br>
<br>
Waves of information fill the room.<br>
Amidst doubts, a sense of history tempts me to believe.<br>
The plot unfolds like the opening of a thriller.<br>
Questions: where is it from, what do we call it.<br>
"The Hydra's Head?"<br>
And what is the false alarm probability?<br>
At last these words have gravity.<br>
For the first time, perhaps gravity has a voice.<br>

Fireworks burst over Herrenhaeuser Garten on my walk home.<br>
I am lured by the spectacle.<br>
On Thursday my impulse was to archive the data, offline, just in case.<br>
On Friday, I wanted to listen to the sound of the merging black holes myself.<br>
My friends and colleagues and I had sat down, playing that little thunderclap again, amplifying and stretching it to hear it better.<br>
Only today, though, when I looked at the Event log, did my fears begin to abate.<br>
All hardware channels checked, it said; our injections, indeed, were not ready.<br>
As fireworks light my way home, I let myself start to think The Event is real.<br>

As the smaller black hole plunged towards the larger one, it knew its death wouldnâ€™t be in vain.<br>
A billion years in the future,<br>
scientists on a tiny blue planet would listen to the song it sang before it went down for the final sleep...<br>
