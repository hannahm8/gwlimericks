<p>This year is the 10 year anniversary of the first gravitaitonal-wave detection!</p>

<p>In celebration, we invite you to share your gravitational-wave limericks. We will publish as many as we can in these pages. Limericks on any and all topics related to gravitational waves are welcome.</p>

<p><b>Go to the <a href="https://hannahm8.github.io/gwlimericks/how-to-submit">How To Submit</a> page to submit your limerick.</b>

<h1>What are gravitational waves?</h1>
<p><a href="https://ligo.org/gravitational-wave-science/">Gravitational waves</a> are ripples in space-time caused by the accelleration of massive objects. Only the most massive objects (such as black holes and neutron stars) make gravitational waves large enought to detect. On 14th September 2015, the observation of gravitational waves from a merging black hole binary (<a href="https://ligo.org/science-summaries/GW150914/">GW150914</a>) was a breakthrough discovery and the beginning of a new type of astronomy. Ground-based observatories, <a href="https://ligo.org/">LIGO</a>, <a href="https://www.ego-gw.it/">Virgo</a>, and <a href="https://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">KAGRA</a> are now making routine gravitational-wave discoveries and revealing a Universe of <a href="https://ligo.org/science-summaries/O3bCatalog/">gravitational-wave signals</a>.</p>

<p>
So, in celebration of a decade of gravitational-wave discovery, we invite you to put pen to paper and write a limerick (or two!) about anything and everything related to gravitational waves. Including all frequencies of gravitational waves, instrumentation, data anlysis, theory, communication, and more.

<b>The rest is is history </b><br>
Gravitational waves seemed a bit of a stretch,<br>
until some mad scientists made a pledge:<br>
To see space-time bend<br>
one laser to mirrors we'll send,<br>
and so the Nobel Prize they fetched. .<br>

A decade since the gravitational wave,<br>
A discovery about which we rave,<br> 
Why not write a rhyme,<br>
To celebrate this time,<br>
Submit your limerick, be brave!<br>

There will be a mission called LISA<br>
soon launched by NASA and ESA<br>
Taking Einstein to space<br>
there detecting his waves<br>
which for a hundred years were just a teaser.<br>
