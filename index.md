<p>This year is the 10 year anniversary of the first gravitaitonal-wave detection!</p>

<p>In celebration, we invite you to share your gravitational-wave limericks. We will publish as many as we can in these pages. Limericks on any and all topics related to gravitational waves are welcome. You can write your limerick in any language.</p>

<p><b>Go to the <a href="https://hannahm8.github.io/gwlimericks/limericks">All Limericks</a> page to read the limericks so far and go to the <a href="https://hannahm8.github.io/gwlimericks/not-limericks">Other Poems</a> page to read poems that are not limericks!</b></p>

<p><b>Go to the <a href="https://hannahm8.github.io/gwlimericks/how-to-submit">How To Submit</a> page to submit your limerick.</b></p>

<h1>What are gravitational waves?</h1>
<p><a href="https://ligo.org/gravitational-wave-science/">Gravitational waves</a> are ripples in space-time caused by the accelleration of massive objects. Only the most massive objects (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a>) make gravitational waves large enough to detect. On 14th September 2015, the observation of gravitational waves from a merging black hole binary (<a href="https://ligo.org/science-summaries/GW150914/">GW150914</a>) was a breakthrough discovery and the beginning of a new type of astronomy. The <a href="https://ligo.org/">LIGO</a>-<a href="https://www.ego-gw.it/">Virgo</a>-<a href="https://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">KAGRA</a> Collaborations are now making routine gravitational-wave discoveries and revealing a Universe of <a href="https://ligo.org/science-summaries/O3bCatalog/">gravitational-wave signals</a>.</p>

<p>
So, in celebration of a decade of gravitational-wave discovery, we invite you to put pen to paper and write your own limerick(s) about anything and everything related to gravitational waves. Including all frequencies of gravitational waves, instrumentation, data anlysis, theory, communication, and more. Go to the <a href="https://hannahm8.github.io/gwlimericks/how-to-submit">How To Submit</a> to get involved.
